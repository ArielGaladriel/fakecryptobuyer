This is my first Django project which I made by myself from scratch. 
It is a web-site were you are able to buy crypto currency (not actually buying, I didn't add a payment system).
You can go through registration process, choose a currency from the list, insert quantity and then "buy" it. 
Before the purchase the script will show you how much you are going to spend.
Non-authenticated users have access only to the main page where they can look up exchange rates. 
Authenticated users have access to their portfolio. 
That portfolio shows next information about every coin bought: quantity, current total cost and how much was spent.
